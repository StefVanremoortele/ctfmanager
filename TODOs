## create docker project for co-development and version control




Project description
-------------------
The goal of this project is to create a platform to register all hackathons you participate in.
You can add hackathons and challenges of different types.
Users can do perform several voting actions: 
    - users can set the priority of a challenge from an active hackathon they participate in
    - users can give challenges and hackathons a rating
Users can give remarks to a hackathon or challenge.
For challenges, it should also be possible register write-ups using markdown syntax.
Hackathons can be searched through, as well as challenges.
At last, it should be possible to create a pdf from the write-ups from each challenge of a hackathon.
 
The app is meant for a limited user base.
